# color-picker
Color picker extension for chrome

Have you ever come across a situation where you see a color on the screen and you want to copy that?? Here is a handy color picker/eye-dropper for you!

On activating the tool, you will be able to pick any color on your screen (on the browser or anywhere on the screen). The HEX code of the color will automatically be copied in your clipboard. The color which you save will remain in your local storage even after you close the browser. You also have the option to remove/delete the color.
